Leonto (Legal Ontology Framework) presents a framework for achieving the 
construction of regulatory ontologies from complex legislative documentation 
specifically from within the AEC (architecture engineering and construction) 
Domain.

The /resources directory contains the entire Scottish Technical Standards 2010
for Domestic Construction. From this material triples can be extracted
and ontologies constructed.

When you execute ConstructJob#run method the output file (containing triples) 
will be written to the same directory as contains this file. It takes the name
'construct.txt'. 

This product includes software developed by The Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

Predominantly this product uses software developed by the Apache Any23 
project (http://any23.apache.org).
